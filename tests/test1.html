At the beginning of the war, Russia mobilised quicker than expected, but they immediately did the wrong thing by invading both Austria-Hungary and Germany at the same time. Doing this meant that they had to spread their troops over both fronts and they cant concentrate on one front at a time. This meant if there was a push on both fronts, Russia would be in trouble. This shows immediately fighting on two fronts was a large contribution to why Russia did so badly during WW1. </p> <p> The second reason that Russia did so badly was because they lost lots of supplies early on. During the battle of Tannenburg in August and the battle of the Masurian Lakes in September the Russians lost vast amounts of equipment and ammunition. The leader at the time was the cousin of Tsar Nicholas II, and he said he was “happy to make these sacrifices”. Also because they had group transporting guns and shells to the front, a third of the army didn’t even have their own rifle. This meant that Russian soldiers went into battle with their bear hands waiting for one of their comrades to die in front of them so they could have their rifle. This obviously contributed to the fact that Russia did so badly during the first World War. </p>',
